                <h2 class="reveal">I'm Vaibhav. A developer, maker and problem solver.</h2>
                <p class="reveal">The world of web development has always intrigued me, and I've enthusiastically dived into mastering the craft of creating captivating online experiences. From the early days of HTML and CSS to the latest web technologies, I've dedicated myself to becoming a skilled web developer.</p>
                
                <p class="reveal">With a strong foundation in coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've honed my expertise in building
                responsive and visually appealing websites. I've delved into frameworks and libraries like React and node to create
                dynamic and interactive web applications that engage users.</p>
                
                <p class="reveal">What drives me as a web developer is the opportunity to shape the digital landscape by crafting functional and
                user-friendly websites. It's more than just writing code; it's about understanding the needs of users, designing
                intuitive user interfaces, and implementing seamless navigation experiences. I take pride in delivering websites that
                not only showcase compelling content but also provide a smooth and enjoyable browsing journey.</p>

                <p class="reveal">This is one of my favourite quotes(by Peter Ducker:)</p>

                <h2 class="reveal">“Efficiency is not just about doing things quickly; it's also about discerning what truly matters.”</h2>
                <p class="reveal">This quote deeply resonates with me. I have no interest in creating for the sake of aesthetics alone. My passion lies in
                building, designing, and crafting ideas and products that have a real impact and meaning in the world. Quality and
                purpose are at the core of everything I create.</p>
